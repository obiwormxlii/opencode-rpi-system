I'll help you implement changes using the Research → Plan → Implement methodology.

This workflow:
1. **Research**: Understand the codebase and what needs to change
2. **Plan**: Create a detailed, atomic implementation plan
3. **Implement**: Execute the plan step-by-step
4. **Verify**: Validate against standards (blocking on critical issues)

What would you like to implement or fix?

Please describe:
- What feature/fix you want
- Why it's important
- Any constraints or context we should know
