description: Research → Plan → Implement workflow
agent: build

I'll help you implement changes using the Research → Plan → Implement methodology.

This workflow:
1. **Research**: Understand the codebase and what needs to change
2. **Plan**: Create a detailed, atomic implementation plan
3. **Implement**: Execute the plan step-by-step
4. **Verify**: Validate against standards (blocking on critical issues)

**Task**: $ARGUMENTS

Let me start by researching the codebase to understand what needs to change.

I'll invoke the research agent to analyze:
- Relevant files and architecture
- Integration points and dependencies
- Current implementation patterns
- What needs to be modified

After research completes, I'll create a detailed implementation plan.
