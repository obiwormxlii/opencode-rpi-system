description: Execute the implementation plan
agent: implement

I'll execute the plan step-by-step.

For each atomic phase, I will:
1. Mark the phase as in_progress in the todo list
2. Make the necessary code changes
3. Run tests
4. Report results
5. Mark the phase as completed

I'll check for any CRITICAL issues in the verification report first.
If blocking issues exist, they must be resolved before implementation.

Ready to begin?
