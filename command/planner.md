description: Create implementation plan from research
agent: planner

I'll create a detailed implementation plan for: $ARGUMENTS

The plan will include:
- Atomic phases with exact steps
- File paths and line numbers
- Before/after code snippets
- Test strategy for each phase
- Rollback procedures
- Risk assessment

Plan will be saved to `.tmp/plans/current-plan.md`

Each phase will become a todo item for tracking progress.
