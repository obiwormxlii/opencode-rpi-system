# Project Initialization

I'll help you initialize a comprehensive project structure in `.opencode/project/`.

This creates:
- **Architecture documentation** - System design, database schema, API specs, infrastructure
- **Project roadmap** - Epics, phases, and day-sized tasks optimized for RPI workflow
- **Project-specific configuration** - AGENTS.md and opencode.json
- **Progress tracking** - Automated status updates based on git commits

## Project Type

First, let me check if this is a **greenfield** (new) or **brownfield** (existing) project.

**Greenfield projects**: I'll interview you about requirements and generate comprehensive documentation from scratch.

**Brownfield projects**: I'll analyze your existing codebase (dependencies, git history, database schema, file structure) and reverse-engineer documentation.

**Is this a greenfield (new) or brownfield (existing) project?**

Please respond with:
- `greenfield` - New project, start from requirements interview
- `brownfield` - Existing project, analyze and document

Or type `cancel` to exit.
