I'll verify the implementation against:
- SOLID principles
- Atomic design (if applicable)
- Security standards
- Type safety
- Code quality guidelines
- Project-specific standards

Verification is read-only. I'll flag issues and provide recommendations.

CRITICAL issues will BLOCK implementation until fixed.

Verification report will be saved to `.tmp/verification/latest-report.md`
