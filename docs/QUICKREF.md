## Agents

| Agent | Model | Mode | Purpose |
|-------|-------|------|---------|
| **Project-Architect** 🆕 | Opus 4.5 | Subagent | Initialize greenfield projects via interview |
| **Research** | Opus 4.5 | Subagent | Understand codebase, compress findings |
| **Plan** | Sonnet 4.5 | Subagent | Create atomic implementation plans |
| **Implement** | Sonnet 4.5 | Primary | Execute plan step-by-step |
| **Verify** | Opus 4.5 | Subagent | Validate standards (BLOCKS on critical) |
| **Explore** | Haiku 4.5 | Subagent | Fast exploration for Research |

## Key Principles

### 1. Always Research First ✅
Research is auto-run. It provides context for planning.

### 2. Atomic Phases 🧩
Plans break work into small, independent, testable changes.

### 3. Context Compaction 📦
- Stay below 40% token usage ("smart zone")
- Delegate to sub-agents
- Compress findings into markdown

### 4. Verification Blocks 🚨
- **CRITICAL** issues block implementation
- **RECOMMENDATIONS** are warnings only

### 5. Mental Alignment 🧠
All phases produce human-readable documents for team review.

## Verification Status

### ✅ APPROVED
No critical issues. Safe to merge.

### ⚠️ APPROVED WITH NOTES
Recommendations provided. Consider addressing.

### 🚨 BLOCKED
Critical issues must be fixed:
- Hardcoded secrets
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Type errors
- Missing authentication
- Unhandled errors

## Common Tasks

### Initialize New Project 🆕
```
/project-init
# Choose: greenfield
# Answer interview questions
# Review generated structure
```

### Initialize Existing Project 🆕
```
/project-init
# Choose: brownfield
# Wait for codebase analysis
# Review and refine findings
```

### Check Project Status 🆕
```
/project-status
# See current epic, phase, task
# View next recommended work
```

### Start New Feature
```
/rpi "Add user profile page with edit functionality"

# Or with more detail
/rpi "Add user profile page with edit functionality. Must support avatar upload, bio editing, and profile visibility settings"
```

### Understand Existing Code
```
/research "how does authentication work"
```

### Review Plan Before Implementing
```
/planner "refactor database connection pooling"
# Review .tmp/plans/current-plan.md
# Then approve and:
/implement
```

### Compress Long Conversation
```
/compact
```

### Check Code Quality
```
/verify
```

## Standards Checked

### SOLID ✓
- Single Responsibility
- Open/Closed
- Liskov Substitution
- Interface Segregation
- Dependency Inversion

### Security 🔒
- No hardcoded secrets
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS prevention
- Authentication/authorization
- Input validation

### Code Quality 📝
- Type safety (strict mode)
- Error handling
- Naming conventions
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Test coverage (80%+)

### Atomic Design 🎨 (Frontend)
- Atoms → Molecules → Organisms → Templates → Pages

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Context too large | Use `/compact` |
| Research not finding files | Check `.gitignore`, create `.ignore` |
| Verification always blocking | Review `.opencode/standards/` |
| Plan too vague | Provide more context in `/rpi` description |
| Implementation failing | Check `.tmp/verification/latest-report.md` |

## Customization

### Project Standards
Edit: `.opencode/standards/custom-standards.md`

### Blocking Criteria
Edit: `~/.config/opencode/rules/rpi-blocking-criteria.md`

### Agent Prompts
Edit: `~/.config/opencode/prompt/*.txt`

### Model Selection
Edit: `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`

## Tips

1. **Be Specific**: Detailed descriptions → better research → better plans
2. **Review Plans**: Always review before implementing
3. **Fix Critical Issues**: Don't skip verification blockers
4. **Use Sub-agents**: Let agents delegate for better context management
5. **Keep Standards Updated**: Maintain `.opencode/standards/custom-standards.md`

## Example Session

```bash
# Start OpenCode
opencode

# Navigate to project
cd /path/to/project

# Run RPI workflow with description
/rpi "Add email verification to user registration. Users should receive an email with a verification link. After clicking, their account is activated. Add verification check on login to prevent unverified users from accessing the app."

# System runs Research → Plan → Implement → Verify
# Review each phase in .tmp/

# If BLOCKED, fix issues and re-verify
/verify

# If APPROVED, commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add email verification to registration"
```
