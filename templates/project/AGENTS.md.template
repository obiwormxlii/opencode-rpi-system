## Development Workflow

### Standard RPI Workflow

When implementing features, always follow the RPI methodology:

1. **Research** (`/research`) - Understand the codebase and requirements
   - Read `.opencode/project/architecture/` docs for system context
   - Check current epic/phase/task in `.opencode/project/planning/`
   - Analyze existing patterns and conventions

2. **Plan** (`/planner`) - Create detailed implementation plan
   - Reference task acceptance criteria from `.opencode/project/planning/epics/`
   - Align with architectural patterns documented in architecture docs
   - Break into atomic, testable steps

3. **Implement** (`/implement`) - Execute the plan
   - Follow project coding standards in `.opencode/standards/custom-standards.md`
   - Update task STATUS after completion
   - Run verification before committing

4. **Verify** (`/verify`) - Validate against standards
   - Check SOLID principles
   - Verify security requirements
   - Ensure type safety and test coverage
