# Architecture Directory

**Purpose**: Contains comprehensive architecture documentation for the [PROJECT_NAME] project.

## Contents

This directory documents the technical architecture and design decisions for the project:

- **overview.md** - High-level system design, components, and technology stack
- **database-schema.md** - Complete database schema with ERD and entity documentation
- **api-design.md** - API endpoint specifications, authentication, and error handling
- **frontend-architecture.md** - UI component structure, state management, and routing
- **infrastructure.md** - Deployment, hosting, CI/CD, and DevOps procedures
- **diagrams/** - Mermaid diagrams for system visualization

## How to Use

### For Developers

When implementing features:
1. Read **overview.md** first to understand the system design
2. Check **database-schema.md** for data model details
3. Review **api-design.md** for endpoint contracts
4. Consult **frontend-architecture.md** for UI patterns
5. Reference **infrastructure.md** for deployment procedures

### For Agents (RPI Workflow)

**Research Phase** (`/research`):
- Always read architecture docs relevant to the task
- Reference these docs in research snapshots
- Use architecture context when analyzing code

**Planning Phase** (`/planner`):
- Align implementation plans with documented architecture
- Reference specific architecture sections in plans
- Ensure new code follows established patterns

**Verification Phase** (`/verify`):
- Check implementations against architectural standards
- Validate that changes don't violate design principles
- Ensure consistency with documented patterns

## Updating Architecture Docs

Architecture documentation should be updated when:
- Major design decisions are made
- New components or services are added
- Database schema changes occur
- API endpoints are added or modified
- Infrastructure changes affect deployment

Use `/project-update` to sync architecture docs with code changes.
