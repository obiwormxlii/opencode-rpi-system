# Planning Directory

**Purpose**: Contains project planning, roadmap, and work breakdown structure for [PROJECT_NAME].

## Contents

This directory organizes the project into manageable, day-sized tasks:

- **roadmap.md** - High-level project timeline, milestones, and epic overview
- **epics/** - Feature breakdown into epics, phases, and tasks
- **.history/** - Historical snapshots of planning documents (auto-generated)

## Structure

## Workflow

### Epic Structure

**Epic** = Large feature or capability (e.g., "Authentication System")
- Contains multiple phases
- Has clear success criteria
- Represents 1-2 weeks of work

**Phase** = Logical implementation sequence within an epic (e.g., "Backend", "Frontend")
- Contains multiple tasks
- Phases usually completed sequentially
- Represents 2-5 days of work

**Task** = Single day's work, optimized for one RPI session
- Atomic and self-contained
- Has clear acceptance criteria
- Estimated at 1 RPI session duration

### Task States

- **pending** - Not started yet
- **in_progress** - Currently being worked on
- **completed** - Finished and verified
- **blocked** - Waiting on dependencies

### Working with Tasks

1. **Find Next Task**: Check `roadmap.md` "Current Focus" section or run `/project-status`
2. **Start Task**: Run `/rpi "implement task-NNN"`
3. **Complete Task**: Commit with message like `feat: complete task-001 - user authentication`
4. **Track Progress**: Run `/project-update` to sync status (or auto-updates after commits)

## Auto-Update System

The project tracking system automatically updates when you:
- Complete a task (commit message includes "complete task-NNN" or "closes #task-NNN")
- Finish an epic (commit message includes "epic complete" or "milestone")
- Make significant changes (commit includes "feat: complete X")

Manual updates: `/project-update`

## For Agents (RPI Workflow)

**Research Phase** (`/research`):
- Check current epic/phase/task in roadmap
- Read task file for context and requirements
- Use task acceptance criteria to guide research

**Planning Phase** (`/planner`):
- Reference specific task being implemented
- Align plan with task acceptance criteria
- Break task into atomic implementation steps

**Implementation Phase** (`/implement`):
- Follow task acceptance criteria
- Update task STATUS.md on completion
- Add RPI session notes to task file

**Verification Phase** (`/verify`):
- Validate against task acceptance criteria
- Check epic-specific requirements

## History Tracking

The `.history/` directory contains snapshots of planning documents:
- Created automatically on major milestones
- Timestamped for audit trail
- Useful for "what changed" analysis
